         <h2>What Is Hockey?</h2>
         <p>Hockey is a term used to denote a family of various types of both summer and winter team sports which originated on <br>
            either an outdoor field, sheet of ice, or dry floor such as in a gymnasium.<br>
             While these sports vary in specific rules, numbers of players, apparel, and playing surface, they share broad characteristics<br>
             of two opposing teams using sticks to propel a ball or disk into a goal.<br>
            There are many types of hockey. Some games make the use of skates, either wheeled or bladed, while others do not.<br>
            In order to help make the distinction between these various games, the word hockey is often preceded by another word, as in field hockey, ice hockey, roller hockey, rink hockey, or floor hockey.</p>
